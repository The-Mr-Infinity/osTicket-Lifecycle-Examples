To start of this example, I first created a few sample tickets that will be viewed, assigned, worked out, and resolved throughout the ticket process.

Continuing to the Intake Phase, I could see which open tickets I had when logged into one of the sample agent accounts. I could find these open tickets by clicking on the tickets tab and then going into the open tickets section.

Since I was signed into an Admins account, I could control the whole assignment process. Here I can change the status, Priority, Department, and which agent I want to assign the open ticket. Also, in this section, any communication between the assigned agent and recipients will be updated and stored on this open ticket.

During this step, I wanted to show examples of how it would look while working the open ticket from the beginning of the process until before the ticket is resolved and closed.

<p>
To conclude this tutorial, I showed that the ticket had been resolved and closed. You can see the tickets that have been resolved in osTicket by going to the tickets tab and clicking on the closed tickets section. Any ticket that has been closed by any admins or agents will be stored in this section.
